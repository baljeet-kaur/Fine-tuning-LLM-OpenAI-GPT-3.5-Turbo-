Cancel the carbon tax but still fight global warming? How are you going to do that effectively if you don't put a cost on polluting?


A big tax credit to encourage parents to keep their kids out of school? How will you ensure kids are getting an adequate education from do-it-yourself amateurs? It sounds like a really bad idea.

The middle class has already earned its benefit, which you confuse as separate matters. By definition, the middle-class cannot rob itself. Rather, repeal destroys tax revenues originating virtually entirely among the rich, particularly the very rich.

But I do sympathize with your desperation to portray taxation on the wealthy as something else, voters having little sympathy to the plight of the uber-wealthy.

Thank you for the nice words.  My article was sincere in that ultimately, having two or more strong, but sensible political parties is needed to keep a Democracy alive.  The highest form of Government, is a Representative type of system where the leaders (full of imperfect humans) are running the show in a way that We The People approve of.  Too many years of the divide becoming wider and wider - especially in the last 8 years - is why Donald Trump became elected.   Too much centralized power leads to Tyranny (i.e. failure).  That was the Legacy of Obama.  When asked who will I vote for: I always reply, start with the understanding that Liberty & Freedom is what Humans yearn for.  The farthest from that is forms of Tyranny.  Whoever will pursue polices closer to the former, gets my vote.   That is why I voted for Donald Trump.  Not Donald himself, but his promised policies were/are closer to the necessary cure for our ailing Country, than what Hillary wanted to do.

However,  I suspect the American electorate had enough of the entitlements gang and their claims to ""firsts"" and glass ceilings.  They elected a white male Republican, in what many would call a backlash.

Meanwhile, the 'first female president' glass ceiling remains intact.  Hillary failed. Her political career is over and her hubris checked.  Only time will tell if the Democrats' notion of that title will be filled by a Democrat or, the gods forbid, (smile) ....... a Republican!",not toxic

So Trudeau 2.0 shares the blame and is ultimately responsible for the cynical power grab machinations since he was elected and cannot simply pass the buck to Butts.

""[examined] 11 944 climate abstracts from 1991–2011 matching the topics 'global climate change' or 'global warming'. We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW, 32.6% endorsed AGW, 0.7% rejected AGW and 0.3% were uncertain about the cause of global warming. Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming.""

Note that these abstracts included papers from the 90's, when the science was far less certain.  In the past 30 years, the consensus has moved to essentially 100%.

Mandatory telecommuting and 3 day work weeks throughout the province would solve all transportation needs.

Urban family housing is easily resolved with the replacement of a east van blocks with factory built 6 story  wood frame apartments at $70K per pop - see China's broad group for a how to.

The $10B presently totally wasted on the Site C dam would finance all the accommodation needed, which unlike the dead loss of Site C, would pay for itself with rentals and rent to own.

Lots of single family homes would be left for Chinese investors, eager to return all the $trillions we sent their way with our Walmart purchase. A hefty tax on sales over $1 million would help finance our new public housing.

Colorado, Washington, and Oregon have all had to look to reduce  initial 30% government taxation on pot, as the black market was still competing.

Back then, immigrants were not the financial burden that they are today if they fail, and many do fail at supporting themselves.

Some other developed countries ration care directly. Some spend less on facilities, technology, or physician incomes, leading to long waits for care. Such trade-offs are not inherently bad, and not all health care is of equal value, though that would seem to be a determination most appropriately made by patients rather than the government.

I'm certainly a strong supporter of property rights, but there is a balance that's necessary when you have many land owners in close proximity to each other because there is some spill-over affect.  That's why we have cites/towns, and rural areas.  The choice to own land in a city/town comes with the knowledge that property development will have more limits places on it (zoning) as compared to rural land ownership where there aren't nearly as many close-proximity neighbors.

Now, while that is a justification for zoning in cities/towns, it's not an endorsement of extreme zoning limitations.  I still favor only modest limits applied by zoning.  Land owners still ought to have quite a bit of leeway with what they can do with their property.

3485,3486,The Alaska pipeline traverses a wilderness lacking in people.  The environmental costs continue to mount from both ends.  The EXXON-VALDEX in one event literally destroyed an ecosystem for the short term and continues to destroy many species.  The pipeline was monitored throughout the building to require the safest possible construction by government oversight and environmental activists.  Government monitoring provided more jobs than the pipeline. Many spills including the explosion of one station occurred soon after startup and continue to occur as more workers are jettisoned to monitor.  One rifle slug punched a hole in it.  The DAPL is accessible throughout by roads and in highly populated areas.  Rich farmlands abound and all depend on water.  One spill could be disastrous as none of the safety factors built into the AK pipeline exist in lower 48 pipelines.  Multiple spills and blowouts have occurred as safety is secondary to profit.  ND oil is toxic and highly flammable.,not toxic

5571,5572,"Oregon Center for Public Policy July 2016:

Several weeks ago the Oregon legislature’s economists in the Legislative Revenue Office (LRO) came out with an estimate of how the proposal to raise taxes on large, mainly out-of-state corporations would impact the Oregon economy….

While the report fantasizes that a little bit of the costs will be passed along to consumers (another number well within the margin of error in a five year projection), its authors acknowledge the report did not consider the impact of internet sales and other factors that would limit the ability of affected corporations to stick consumers with the bill….
The decision whether to raise taxes on large, mainly out-of-state corporations is too important to be based on fantastic estimates. Oregonians need facts they can rely on — such as the fact that Oregon corporate taxes have declined dramatically over the decades.
